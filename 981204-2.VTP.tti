OL,4,BFallout 2 uses the same interface and  
OL,5,Bgraphics engine as its predecessor;    
OL,6,Bthere's no real reason why this        
OL,7,Bcouldn't have been an add-on pack.     
OL,9,FHowever, the few improvements to the   
OL,10,Fgameplay - that tedious time limit is  
OL,11,Fno more, and the game has been         
OL,12,Fgenerally speeded up - improve things  
OL,13,Fimmeasurably.                          
OL,15,BYes, it's a rip-off, but sometimes it's
OL,16,Bnice to be ripped off. And mutant rats 
OL,17,Band machine guns make a nice change    
OL,18,Bfrom dragons and eldritch lightning.
